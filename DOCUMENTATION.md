## Pseudo-Code

*(Provide detailed pseudo-code explaining the logic of your program. Outline your functions for depth map generation, recursive geometry, and tessellation, and how they contribute to the final structural canopy.)*

### Example Structure:

1. **Main Function: Generating the Canopy**

   - **Inputs**:
     - `base_surface`: The initial surface for the canopy.
     - `depth_map_control`: Control parameter for depth variation.
     - `recursion_params`: Parameters for recursive supports.
     - `tessellation_strategy`: Strategy for surface tessellation.
     - `support_points`: Points where supports will be generated.

   - **Process**:
     - **Generate Depth Map**:
       - Modify `base_surface` using a control function.
     - **Tessellate Surface**:
       - Divide the modified surface into panels.
     - **Generate Vertical Supports**:
       - Create supports using recursive geometry.

   - **Outputs**:
     - `canopy_mesh`: The tessellated canopy shell.
     - `supports`: The vertical support structures.

2. **Functions**

   - **`generate_depth_map(surface, control_value)`**
     - *Purpose*: Modify the input surface to create depth variations.
     - *Implementation Details*:
       - Use mathematical functions to adjust control points.
       - Explore different methods for depth manipulation.

   - **`tessellate_surface(surface, strategy)`**
     - *Purpose*: Tessellate the surface based on the chosen strategy.
     - *Implementation Details*:
       - Implement grid-based, triangular, Voronoi, or other tessellation algorithms.
       - Ensure non-uniformity in the tessellation pattern.

   - **`generate_recursive_supports(start_point, params, depth)`**
     - *Purpose*: Generate branching structures for supports.
     - *Implementation Details*:
       - Use recursion to create complex geometries.
       - Control recursion with parameters like `max_depth` and `angle`.

## Technical Explanation

*(Provide a concise explanation of your code, focusing on how you implemented depth map manipulation, recursive geometry generation, and surface tessellation in Grasshopper Python. Discuss how your approach generates the final structural canopy and the mathematical principles involved.)*

### Topics to Cover:

- **Depth Map Generation**
  - Explain how you manipulated the surface geometry.
  - Discuss the mathematical functions used (e.g., sine, cosine).
  - Describe how control parameters affect the depth variations.

- **Surface Tessellation**
